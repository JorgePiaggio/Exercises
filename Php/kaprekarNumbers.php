/*

A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property. If you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers, you have the same value you started with.

Consider a positive whole number n with d digits. We square to arrive at a number that is either 2xd digits long or (2xd)-1 digits long. Split the string representation of the square into two parts, l and r. The right hand part, r must be d digits long. The left is the remaining substring. Convert those two substrings back to integers, add them and see if you get n.

Example

n = 5
d = 1

First calculate that n^2 = 25. Split that into two strings and convert them back to integers 2 and 5. Test 2 + 5 =7 != 5, so this is not a modified Kaprekar number. If n = 9, still d = 1, and n^2 = 81. This gives us 1 + 8 = 9, the original n.

Note: r may have leading zeros.


Here's an explanation from Wikipedia about the ORIGINAL Kaprekar Number (spot the difference!):

    In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again. For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45Â² = 2025 and 20+25 = 45.


Given two positive integers p and q where p is lower than q, write a program to print the modified Kaprekar numbers in the range between p and q, inclusive. If no modified Kaprekar numbers exist in the given range, print INVALID RANGE.


kaprekarNumbers has the following parameter(s):

    int p: the lower limit
    int q: the upper limit


Prints

It should print the list of modified Kaprekar numbers, space-separated on one line and in ascending order. If no modified Kaprekar numbers exist in the given range, print INVALID RANGE. No return value is required.

Note: Your range should be inclusive of the limits.


Sample Input

STDIN   Function
-----   --------
1       p = 1
100     q = 100


Sample Output

1 9 45 55 99

Explanation

1, 9, 45, 55 and 99 are the modified Kaprekar Numbers in the given range.
